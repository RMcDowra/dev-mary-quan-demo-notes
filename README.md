# Importance of Static/Dynamic IP

Static IP
- A static IP is a permanet IP that does not change. This is useful for web servers, this type of IP is used by companies who want to communicate globally.
- It also makes it easier for a user to navigate to a website that is using a static IP.

Dynamic IP 
- A dynamic IP is the complete opposite of a static IP. It does change and it is not used for companies nor is it tied to certain person.
- Dynamic IP is used consumer devices such as phones, personal computers, etc.

When it comes to dev-mary having a static IP is useful because if the app was actually published into the real world, having a constant non changing IP would make it easier for people to access and not have to worry about IP changing and possibly messing up gaining access to the app.
